A Security Perspective on the LoRaWAN Protocol: 
Analysis and Countermeasures against Cyberattacks

Stefan Ilie




Supervised by: W. Fernando


ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project explores the security vulnerabilities within LoRaWAN, a widely used protocol for long-range, low-power IoT communication. The focus is on exposing and simulating critical attacks targeting LoRaWAN nodes, such as **replay attacks**, **jamming attacks**, and **battery depletion attacks**. The project combines theoretical research with both **visual Python simulations** and **practical Arduino experiments** to highlight how LoRaWANâ€™s architectural choices create potential weaknesses.
