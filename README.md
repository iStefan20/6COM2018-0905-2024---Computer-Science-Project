 A Security Perspective on the LoRaWAN Protocol:  Analysis and Countermeasures against Cyberattacks

Overview
 This project explores LoRaWAN security vulnerabilities by visually demonstrating jamming, replay, and energy depletion attacks using Python. Additionally, it involves setting up a practical LoRaWAN environment with an Arduino MKR WAN 1310   board, a DHT temperature sensor, and an X000016 antenna for hands-on experimentation.
 The scope of this project is to simulate real-life scenarios, identify threats and vulnerabilities in LoRaWAN, and develop security improvements.
